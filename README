Contents:
getTheAPOD.command -------- Gets NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day and sets it as the wallpaper (need modification for paths)
PLOICmail.py -------------- A script to send lots of mail, each with a different subject line, to an address. Useful for dealing with trolling friends
redactor.py --------------- A doodle I made to search a file of text and replace each occurence of a string with "[REDACTED]"


PLEASE feel free to modify these however you like (they could probably do with some fixing). Just remember: Share Alike!

Happy Penguin!
